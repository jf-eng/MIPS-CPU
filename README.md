This repository contains coursework submission for an Imperial College Module on Instruction Architecture. The codebase implements a 32-bit big-endian MIPS architecture CPU, compatible with Avalon Bus Interface. The CPU was written to fit the specifications defined [here](https://github.com/m8pple/elec50010-2021-cpu-cw), scoring 91% on the coursework.

# Testing
Test benches were written to verify the functionality of the CPU. The testing approach can be summarised in the chart below.
